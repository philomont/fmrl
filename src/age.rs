/// Two passes, both of which can only convert pixels *to* paper:
///
/// 1. **Morphological erosion** — any non-paper pixel with ≥ 4 paper
///    8-neighbours (out-of-bounds treated as paper) becomes paper.
///    This gentler threshold ensures gradual erosion from edges while
///    preserving the core of larger ink regions for multiple save/load cycles.
///
/// 2. **Short-run elimination** — scan every row then every column.  Any
///    non-paper run whose length ≤ `RUN_THRESHOLD` becomes paper.  This
///    collapses isolated dots and thin bridges that erosion leaves behind,
///    and ensures the surviving non-paper regions form wide, regular blocks
///    that zlib can compress efficiently.
///
/// Because both passes only convert to paper, the information content of the
/// image is strictly non-increasing.  Repeated application eventually renders
/// all pixels paper (all indices equal 0).
